# Regression Exploration Project

An end-to-end exploratory and predictive analysis using multiple regression models to understand key drivers and forecast a continuous target variable. This notebook walks through data cleaning, feature engineering, model fitting (Linear, Ridge, Lasso), and evaluation—culminating in a test‐set **R² = 0.78** with the best model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling**: scikit-learn (LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso)  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter for interactive exploration
